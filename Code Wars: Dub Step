## Notes from the Dub Step problem

enumerate(): creates a list of tuples from a list where the left item in each paranthesis is the list index, and the right item is the list item.
	example: if you use enumerate() on ["this", "list"], it would create [(0, "this"), (1, "list")
    
Negative numbers index backwards. If you need to remove the first and last characters in a string, you can print string[1:-1], meaning only the characters within the range of index points 1 (second character on the left) and -1 (second character on the right).

If you need to get rid of multiple spaces in a string and replace them with one space, use string.split() followed by " ".join(string). The split function, for some reason unknown to me, doesn't include spaces when it splits the string apart into a list (it splits them __at__ the spaces, so that's likely why). Whatever goes between the "" before .join is placed between each list item when the list is joined back together into a string.
